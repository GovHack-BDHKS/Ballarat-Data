Much scarier than anywhere in the Melbourne or Sydney CBD. It a cesspit of hooliganism- swearing, bottle smashing, daylight drunks, aggressive swearing, screaming, cigarette and cash beggars, all topped off with a revolting daily display of litter! As a recently commenced PhD student at Fed University, I now suffer the daily misfortune of having to visit this frightening place. I travel from Creswick. The Creswick bus used to leave from further down Little Bridge Street - now with the new transport system parties from all areas are forced to gather together in one place- it results in a daily congregation of hooligans. The more pleasantly behaved individuals are often left to cluster like frightened penguins amid the chaos.  It would be far better if the busses each left from different locations, to break up this daily pattern of congregation. Some services could pick up from outside Big W only, while others pick up only from Little Bridge Street. Alternatively - outside Myer only. Please break up this gang-like congregation. 
A certain arrogant bravado arises from having so many unpoliced young people congregate at the shelter, and this often results in ?pushing ahead? in the queue once the bus comes. More than just bad manners, it comes across as bullying. No wonder polite elderly individuals, whom I once use to see on the Creswick bus, are now too scared to use the service as joining the unruly congregation at the interchange is now compulsory ? as there are no centrally located options for catching the bus.
 Travellers can't wait for the bus to come, not so as to get home, but just to get away from the most unpleasant aspect of Ballarat.  The women I speak too at the stop, often express the terror they feel at the Little Bridge Street bus exchange. I met a female friend huddled in a corner at night in the shelter and together we observed that only one light was working out of six in the entire shelter! She remarked that 'perhaps it was better to be able to hide in the darkness?. The area is also subject to drive by hooning. The shelter is also a very unpleasant place for men.
There is no sense of order at the shelter. If the council requested that time light  displays were installed, showing when buses where going to arrive, as they do in Geelong and Melbourne, then at least this would be a sense of order- especially as the busses are consistently late. This provides an opening for unsolicited conversation, 'Excuse me- but has the ten bus been? Oh, and by the way do have a spare smoke? Do you have any spare change? Do you know so-n-so? etc.
There are never any Myki ticket inspectors active on the services departing from the Little Bridge Street Interchange. Many youths now board the bus and claim that they have no cash or have lost their Myki card- the driver routinely warn them that ticket inspector night fine them - but this never occurs. (Apparently denial of transport is not an option for the divers)  It has had a snowball effect on the unruly behaviour, which often continuous onto the bus. (Sadly, I recently witnessed racial abuse of a young driver who had let a large rowdy party board his bus claiming not to have tickets. When he stopped the bus and asked them to quieten down please- he was met with shouts of ?This is my country!?) If the council was to invite or encourage the PTV to send ticket inspectors to Ballarat, it might at least hint at sense of policing.
There are cameras at the stop, but no indication that they work. Maybe some monitors showing that activity is being recorded would assist. Signage bringing attention to their existence might also be of use.
Also, the daily littering ritual- which resembles the sticky mess once made only at the end of the school year - should be addressed. The mess is swept away each night, but the cause not attended. What ever happened to littering fines? Or to fines for public swearing or being drunk in public.
There are transport police at the railway station, but the Little Bridge Street bus shelter is where they are really needed.
